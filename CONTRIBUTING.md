## Using the issue tracker

## Open issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

### Request a community
### Bug reports
### Feature requests

## Pull requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!
